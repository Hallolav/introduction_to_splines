# An Introduction To Splines
This GitHub contains the accompanying code and data to ``An introduction to splines'', which is a reader I have written for the course Contemporary Statistics. A hands-on programming exercise in R, this repo can provide useful when learning about splines.

I have scraped wikipedia in order to collect data in this project. The data comes from speedskating matches - as I am a fanatical speedskater myself. It's just a nice way to incorporate one of my hobbies into a school assignment ;)

You'll find two folders in this repo: src and data. At the danger of explaining the obvious, I'll explain their purposes:
- `data` contains the data
- `src` contains the source code
